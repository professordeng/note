title: viva la viva
---

歌名是西班牙语，意思是生命万岁，应该读成 `biba la bida` ，歌由 Coldplay 乐队编曲和作词

这首歌分为 6 段，旋律朗朗上口，律动感极强，不知不觉中会忍不住摇头抖脚，甚至还有点想做模拟卷。

## 歌词部分

I used to rule the world 

Seas would rise when I gave the word

Now in the morning I sleep alone

Sweep the streets I used to own

---

I used to roll the dice （roll the dice 是掷骰子，这里引申为孤注一掷）

Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes

Listen as the crowd would sing

"Now the old king is dead! long live the king!"

One minute I held the key

Next the walls were closed on me

And I discovered that my castles stand

Upon pillars `[ˈpɪləz]` of salt `[sɔːlt]`, pillars of sand `[sænd] `

---

I hear Jerusalem `[dʒəˈruːsələm]` bells are ringing

Roman `[ˈrəʊmən]` Cavalry `[ˈkævlri]` choirs `[ˈkwaɪəz] ` are singing

Be my mirror `[ˈmɪrə(r)]` my sword and shield `[ʃiːld]`

My missionaries `[ˈmɪʃnəriz]` in a foreign `[ˈfɒrən]` field

For some reason I can not explain `[ɪkˈspleɪn]`

Once you go there was never, never an honest `[ˈɒnɪst] ` word

That was when I ruled the world

---

It was the wicked `[ˈwɪkɪd]`and wild `[waɪld]` wind `wɪnd`

Blew `[bluː]` down the doors to let me in 

Shattered `[ˈʃætəd]` windows and the sound of drums

People could not believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries `[ˌrɛvəˈluːʃnəriz]` Wait

For my head `[hed]` on a silver `[ˈsɪlvə]` plate 

Just puppet `[ˈpʌpɪt]` on a lonely string

Oh who would ever want to be king?

---

I hear Jerusalem `[dʒəˈruːsələm]` bells are ringing

Roman `ˈ[rəʊmən]` Cavalry `[ˈkævlri]` choirs `[ˈkwaɪəz]` are singing

Be my mirror my sword and shield

My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can not explain

I know Saint `[seɪnt]` Peter won't call my name

Never an honest word

But that was when I ruled the world

---

`Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh`

Hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

Be my mirror my sword and shield

My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can not explain

I know Saint Peter won't call my name

Never an honest word

But that was when I ruled the world
